# Sudoku Solver

**High-performance C++ Sudoku solver demonstrating algorithmic problem solving**

---

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of a Sudoku solver designed to efficiently solve high-difficulty 9×9 Sudoku puzzles using backtracking and optimized search strategies. The solver was developed to tackle a hard difficulty LeetCode problem and achieved strong runtime performance relative to other solutions.

## Features

- Efficient Sudoku solving algorithm
- Handles standard 9×9 puzzles
- Optimized backtracking implementation with constraint checks
- High runtime performance (98th percentile on the targeted problem)

---

## My Role

- Sole developer
- Designed and implemented the Sudoku solving algorithm in C++
- Focused on performance optimization and correctness of the solution
